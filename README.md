## Future Plans

Here are some upcoming improvements and ideas planned for the bot:

üîÅ Migration from Legacy C# Bot

    Migrate existing Pok√©mon-related commands and systems from the original C# version of the bot.

    Preserve core mechanics and user data where possible.

    Streamline command structure to match the new Discord Application Command (slash command) style.

üí∞ Expanded Economy & Job System

    Add new job types with varying requirements and payouts.

    Implement inventory, item trading, and rewards.

    Add daily/weekly events and randomized job outcomes to increase engagement.

üöÄ Performance Improvements

    Optimize command response times, especially for heavy image and AI generation tasks.

    Use more asynchronous operations to reduce blocking and latency.

üñºÔ∏è AI & Image Generation Upgrades

    Consider alternatives to Flux for image generation to improve quality, speed, and flexibility.

    Explore potential fallback or replacement options for text generation (Ollama is unlikely, but not ruled out).

    Potentially integrate multiple services with automatic fallback or hybrid use.

##  Important Notes

*   **Rate Limits:**  Please use the bot responsibly. Excessive use of commands may be temporarily throttled.
*   **Image Generation Costs:**  AI image generation is a resource-intensive process.  Costs are subject to change.
*   **Bot Updates:**  This README will be updated periodically with new features and improvements.  Check back often!
